This thing has a barebones RTTI system and hotreloading to see if I could
dynamically update structures at runtime.

Since this only patches a single structure, technically you would be patching
a whole "state" structure to make the most use of this system.

You can make the structure patching more complicated since it really only
depends on the RTTI, so the thing in client_dll.c is for testing purposes.

Also pointers expectedly break this epically. Avoid storing char* strings.

Requires SDL2.
